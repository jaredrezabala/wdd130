    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Dry Oar strives to give people an outstanding and safe experience with wild nature. We help you navigate rough waters by supplying you with the equipment and/or the guides you will need to safely head down the river.

With our experienced guides, we assure you the best entertainment and also a different and fun way of learning about nature and its importance of it in our days.  Rafting is an adventure sport and there is a lot to think about before your first trip, but don’t worry, we will guide you through this adventure, we understand that rafting can seem to be a scary outdoor activity but personally we think that anyone with the desire to have a good time can join this adventure, that’s why we strive to teach our visitors about the safety guidelines of the rides, the proper use of the gears and also what to do when they experience fear during the ride. We know that everyone has an adventurous spirit wanting to come out and Dry oar is the place for it to do it. </p>

      Any extreme sports lover and outgoing family would enjoy this experience.

What about people or families who are not into extreme sports? Rafting is for everyone and we understand that can be daunting to face a new adventure that’s why we provide online tours to guide you through this wonderful experience without taking you from the comfort of your home without feeling ready for this experience.
